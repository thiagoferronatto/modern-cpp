# modern-cpp/inc

Contains all header files.

## Contents

- ``algorithms``: contains headers for functions and/or classes that perform algorithms;
- ``data_structures``: contains headers for classes that represent data structures;
- ``math``: contains headers for classes that represent mathematical structures and/or functions that represent mathematical operations;
- ``misc``: contains headers for things that I could not place anywhere else;
- ``tests``: contains, exclusively, headers with declarations of functions that make use of other parts of the repo for testing purposes;
- ``type_traits``: contains headers for my own type traits implementation (it's probably best to just use the STL).
